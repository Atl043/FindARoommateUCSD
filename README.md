Find A Roommate at UCSD for CSE 170/Cogs 120. Zain Ali Baquar, Andrew Li and Joanna Lu

During the winter of 2019, we worked in a team of 3 for CSE 170/COGS120. The project brought us through many challenges such as creating paper prototypes, User stories, POV and more to Create our final product of a mobile web app.
